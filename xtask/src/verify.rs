//! `xtask verify` — one command that runs the Phase 1 acceptance checks and writes a
//! Markdown report a human can read and attach to an issue.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! The ledger (`docs/verification-status.md`) tracks which claims about localplay are
//! *verified* and which are only *type-checked*, and the runbook
//! (`docs/runbooks/phase-1-verification.md`) tells a human how to check each criterion by
//! hand. That procedure is expensive: every criterion is a separate command, and the clip
//! criteria used to require pressing `Ctrl+F8` — which, from a script, means synthesising
//! input. On a machine whose anti-cheat treats synthetic input as hostile, that is not a
//! safe thing to do, so the clip path could not be verified there at all.
//!
//! This harness removes both costs. It starts the buffer with a bounded, documented
//! configuration, drives the clip path through the CLI's own verification-only trigger
//! (`buffer --self-test-clip-after`, an in-process call to the same `Recorder::clip_now`
//! the hotkey calls), measures the process, probes the clip and writes everything down.
//!
//! # It does not synthesise input
//!
//! **Nothing in this file sends, simulates or injects a keyboard or mouse event, and
//! nothing enumerates windows.** There is no `keybd_event`, no `SendInput`, no
//! `SendKeys`, no `mouse_event`, and no enumeration call anywhere in this crate. The
//! self-test flag is the whole mechanism, and it is a function call inside the process
//! under test. That property is the reason the harness exists.
//!
//! # What it cannot do, and says so
//!
//! Every check it cannot perform is listed in the report as *not performed* with the
//! reason — never silently omitted. It cannot verify:
//!
//! * the **desktop GUI** (no window is opened) or its recording wiring;
//! * a **real keypress** (the hotkey listener is installed but not driven);
//! * anything needing a **real game** (the event sources are switched off in the harness
//!   config, and nothing is contacted);
//! * the **live-source clock divergence** between the WGC video clock and the WASAPI
//!   audio clock (not instrumented in this build at all);
//! * whatever the machine's own state makes impossible on the day — a box whose every
//!   encoder works has no unusable vendor to point criterion 7 at, and an endpoint that is
//!   natively 48 kHz never exercises the engine-side conversion.
//!
//! It also cannot tell you *whether the pixels were the desktop*, only that frames flowed:
//! the frame-content check decodes one frame and refuses a single-colour one (the
//! black-frame defect class), but a black screen would look black to it too.

Runs the Phase 1 acceptance checks against the localplay CLI and writes one Markdown
report. It starts the buffer with a bounded configuration (stated in the report), drives
the clip through the CLI's `--self-test-clip-after` trigger — which sends no keyboard or
mouse input — probes the clip it produced, and exits non-zero if any check failed.

options:
  --seconds <N>        how much media to buffer before the self-test clip (default 45)
  --report <PATH>      where the report goes (default target/verify/report.md)
  --work-dir <PATH>    where the run's data directory goes (default target/verify/work)
  --cli <PATH>         an already-built localplay-cli to test (skips the release build)
  --no-build           do not build; use target/release/localplay-cli as it is
  --dev-software-encoder
                       build and run with libx264 instead of a hardware encoder, for a
                       host with no GPU encoder (a development host). Checks that need
                       the real capture/encoder path are then reported as not performed.

             - **Anything needing a real game.** The event sources are switched off in the \
             harness config and nothing is contacted; the Phase 4 integrations still need a bot \
             game and a CS2 round.\n\
             - **The live-source clock divergence** between the WGC video clock and the WASAPI \
             audio clock: not instrumented in this build, so no run can measure it here.\n\
             - **Frame content beyond one frame.** The harness decodes one frame and refuses a \
             single-colour one, but it cannot tell you the pixels were the desktop you expected.\n\
             - **Checks marked _not performed_ above.** Each names its reason; they are not \
             silent.\n\n\
             What the harness *does* establish is in the table: the encoder probe, the run's own \
             rate and timeline numbers, the scratch cap and eviction, the clip the trigger \
             produced (duration, streams, codec, drift, audio level, one decoded frame), and the \
