//! Sidecar acquisition: `xtask sidecars record` and `xtask sidecars fetch`.
//!
//! localplay ships no ffmpeg in the repository (README, design spec §3/§4): the binaries
//! are *sidecars*, downloaded at build time and pinned by SHA-256 in `xtask/sidecars.toml`.
//! The two halves of that pin are deliberately separate commands:
//!
//! * `record` downloads each archive, hashes it and rewrites `sidecars.toml` in place. The
//!   hash it writes is **trust on first use**: it attests nothing about who served the
//!   bytes, only that the bytes are the ones fetched at that moment. What it buys is that
//!   every *later* fetch must match those bytes or fail loudly. A human reviews the URL and
//!   the hash in the diff and commits them; that review is the only trust anchor there is.
//! * `fetch` downloads, verifies the hash against the recorded one, and only then extracts
//!   the paths named in the entry's `binaries` allowlist into `<repo>/binaries/`.
//!
//! Everything security-relevant happens in *this* module rather than in an external
//! `unzip`/`tar` process: the traversal rules ([`validate_entry_path`]), the destination
//! rule ([`entry_destination`]) and the allowlist matching ([`scan`]) are all ordinary Rust
//! functions with tests, and `zip` is only used as a decoder. Windows ships no `unzip.exe`
//! either, which is the second reason not to shell out.
