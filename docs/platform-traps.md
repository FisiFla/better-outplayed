# Platform traps

Bugs that come from an OS behaviour **Linux and Windows do not share**, so a green local
run on one host, or a green CI run on another, can both miss them. Each has bitten this
codebase at least once. Read this before writing socket, file-path or process code that is
expected to work on Windows and macOS.

## Trap 1 — `accept()` makes the accepted socket non-blocking on macOS/BSD

**The rule: after `accept()`, set the socket's blocking mode explicitly. Never assume the
accepted socket is blocking.**

### What happens

A server often makes its **listener** non-blocking so the accept loop can enforce a
deadline (poll `accept()`, give up after a timeout) instead of parking forever in a
blocking `accept()`. That part is fine and portable.

The trap is what `accept()` *returns*. On **macOS and other BSD-derived platforms**, the
accepted socket **inherits the listener's `O_NONBLOCK` flag**. On **Linux and Windows it
does not** — the accepted socket is blocking regardless.

So a socket you deliberately made non-blocking "just for the listener" quietly comes back
non-blocking on the one host this project is developed on — and then:

- a `read`/`write` that would have blocked fails **immediately** with `WouldBlock`
  (`EAGAIN`, `os error 35`) the instant a buffer is full or empty, rather than waiting;
- read/write **timeouts set on the socket are ignored** on a non-blocking socket, so the
  bound you thought you had is not there;
- the symptom is **timing-dependent** — it appears when a buffer happens to fill, so it can
  pass on a warm local run and fail on a fresh CI runner.

The fix is always the same and is a no-op on Linux and Windows:

```rust
let (stream, _peer) = listener.accept()?;
stream.set_nonblocking(false)?;   // do not assume; macOS/BSD inherited O_NONBLOCK
stream.set_read_timeout(Some(timeout))?;
stream.set_write_timeout(Some(timeout))?;
```

### Where it has already happened here

1. **`crates/encoder/src/ffmpeg.rs::accept_within`** — the encoder's loopback-TCP audio
   transport. The listener is non-blocking to bound the "ffmpeg never connected" wait; the
   accepted socket then went non-blocking and `write_all` failed with `WouldBlock` as soon
   as ffmpeg's receive buffer filled. Fixed by `stream.set_nonblocking(false)` after accept
   (commit `82578bd fix(encoder): force the accepted audio socket to blocking mode`); the
   reasoning is at the call site.

2. **`crates/events/src/gsi.rs::handle`** — the CS2/Dota 2 GSI listener. Same listener
   pattern, same inheritance; a non-blocking socket ignored the request read timeout and
   `http` read a `WouldBlock` as a **malformed request (400)** instead of answering the
   client. Fixed by `stream.set_nonblocking(false)` before setting the timeouts (commit
   `c5abc58`). **This one was caught only by CI on a fresh runner** — the failing test
   `crates/events/tests/gsi_listener.rs::a_post_with_no_auth_block_at_all_is_rejected`
   asserted `403` and got `400`:

   ```console
   $ gh run view 35904179918 --log-failed
   … test a_post_with_no_auth_block_at_all_is_rejected … FAILED
   …   left: 400
   …  right: 403
   ```

3. **`crates/events/tests/lol_mock.rs`** — the League mock server's own listener is
   non-blocking so the mock can be stopped; it carries the same guard
   (`stream.set_nonblocking(false)`) for the same reason, with a comment saying so.

### Why the call-site comments are not enough

Each site already has a comment explaining this. They were added *when the bug was fixed*,
which is too late for the next person about to write socket code somewhere else. This file
is the place to look **first**.
