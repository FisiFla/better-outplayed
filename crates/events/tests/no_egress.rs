//! Egress, enforced by inspecting the source tree.
//!
//! Static checks rather than runtime hopes:
//!
//! * no capability that could reach another machine, outside the files that are allowed to
//!   have one and say why ([`no_capability_to_reach_off_this_machine_is_used_outside_its_exemptions`]);
//! * no HTTP client in any manifest, and none in any dependency graph but the one that is
//!   allowed to have it ([`no_http_client_is_a_dependency`]);
//! * TLS certificate verification is relaxed in exactly one file, the one that pins the
//!   loopback address ([`certificate_verification_is_pinned_and_only_the_hostname_check_is_relaxed`]);
//! * every `TcpListener::bind` is pinned to loopback, and the *address* is read rather than
//!   the file ([`every_listener_is_bound_to_loopback`]);
//! * the tree's outbound sockets are exactly the four files that may have them
//!   ([`only_the_loopback_modules_talk_to_a_socket_at_all`]).
//!
//! The capability check is a denylist of *names* rather than an allowlist of constructors,
//! because an allowlist of constructors is only as good as the list: `reqwest::Client` is
//! one spelling of the reqwest client and `reqwest::get`, `reqwest::ClientBuilder::new` and
//! a dozen others are the others. A capability is a crate, a program or a standard-library
//! item, and those are few enough to list.
//!
//! Each exemption is by path and carries its reason. Every check reads code with comment
//! lines removed first, otherwise this module's own prose ("never bind `0.0.0.0`") would
//! satisfy the checks it asserts. Block comments are not stripped; the tree uses none, so one
//! would show up as an offender rather than a silent pass.
//!
//! # The one exception
//!
//! The application is not "zero egress, ever". It is **no egress except one user-initiated
//! update check**: the "Check for updates" button in the settings panel asks one fixed
//! GitHub URL whether there is a newer release, and the artifact it is offered is verified
//! against the minisign public key pinned in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
//! before it is installed.
//!
//! That exception is narrow in three ways, and each of them is a check here:
//!
//! - the *source* denylist above is unchanged — no file in this tree gained a client, a
//!   socket or a name resolution. The plugin's own code is not this project's code;
//! - the *manifest* check still fails on any direct HTTP-client dependency, and the
//!   *graph* check now fails on any resolved graph that contains one, with a single
//!   exemption: the desktop shell's, and only because the updater plugin is in it;
//! - the loopback bind check is untouched. The updater's requests leave the machine; they
//!   are not listeners, and nothing was loosened to let them out.

// The test bodies use `unwrap()` throughout; production code does not.
