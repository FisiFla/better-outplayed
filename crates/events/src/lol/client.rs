//! The one place in replayed that relaxes any part of TLS verification.
//!
//! Riot's Live Client Data API is HTTPS on `127.0.0.1:2999`, with a certificate issued by
//! Riot's "LoL Game Engineering Certificate Authority" that carries no name matching an IP
//! literal. The chain is verified: the client trusts only that pinned root (`riotgames.pem`,
//! published at `static.developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol/riotgames.pem`) and none of the
//! platform's roots. Only the host-name match is relaxed, as it has nothing to match. A process
//! squatting on port 2999 with any other certificate fails the handshake.
//!
//! * The relaxation is a private field of [`LoopbackClient`], built here and nowhere else; no
//!   public API hands out a connector or builds this type from a host name or URL.
//! * The destination is an [`Endpoint`], which can only be loopback, so the relaxed connector
//!   can only be pointed at this machine.
//! * `tests/no_egress.rs` asserts `danger_accept_invalid_certs` appears nowhere and
//!   `danger_accept_invalid_hostnames` only here.
//!
//! The request is written by hand (`GET <path> HTTP/1.1`, `Host: 127.0.0.1:2999`, SNI disabled
//! since the certificate matches no name we could send); [`crate::wire`] reads the response.
