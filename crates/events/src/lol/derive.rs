//! Snapshot to events, as a pure state machine.
//!
//! No socket, clock or log: previous knowledge plus one document yields events, so every rule
//! is a unit test. [`crate::lol::poller`] puts it on a network.
//!
//! The Live Client serves the whole event log so far, and a game is usually well under way
//! before localplay starts. Replaying that history would be a storm of clips of footage nobody
//! asked for, hence the attach policy:
//!
//! | transition | what is emitted |
//! |---|---|
//! | no game to game | `GameStart` only. Every event already in the document is adopted as seen (`adopted_in_progress_events` in the payload counts them), none emitted. |
//! | game to no game | `GameEnd`, once, on the falling edge; every later no-game poll is silent. |
//! | game to game | only events whose id has not been seen. |
//! | a fresh `GameStart` line appears mid-game | the client restarted without the endpoint going quiet: reset, adopt again, emit `GameStart` only. |
//!
//! Idempotence: events are identified by `EventID` (a monotonic per-game counter) and only
//! unseen ids are emitted, so polling the same document twice emits nothing. A document whose
//! events carry no id (the client has omitted it) falls back to a key derived from the event's
//! content, which keeps idempotence without inventing an ordering.
//!
//! | `EventName` | kind |
//! |---|---|
//! | `ChampionKill` | `Kill` / `Death` / `Assist`, by comparing `KillerName` / `VictimName` / `Assisters` against the watched player's names |
//! | `DragonKill`, `BaronKill`, `HeraldKill`, `TurretKilled` / `FirstBrick`, `InhibKilled` | `Dragon`, `Baron`, `Herald`, `Turret`, `Inhibitor` |
//! | `EpicMonsterKill` (by `MonsterType`), `HordeKill`, `FirstBlood`, `Ace`, `Multikill` | the matching sub-kind, else `Objective` |
//! | `GameStart`, `GameEnd` | the state machine above, never the table |
//! | anything else (`MinionsSpawning`, a future name) | nothing |
//!
//! A `ChampionKill` involving nobody the document names as the watched player is not emitted
//! (a fight the user was not in is not a clip). When the document names no player at all (the
//! loading screen, or a patch that moved the field) there is nothing to compare, and the kill is
//! emitted as `Kill` with the names in its payload rather than dropped.
