//! The poll loop: one `GET` a second, the tracker, and the logging discipline.
//!
//! Poll about once a second, yet do not report "no game" as an error every second:
//!
//! * one poll a second, always: a refused loopback connection costs microseconds and makes a
//!   game's start noticed within a second;
//! * a condition that lasts is logged once, at the level it deserves, and its end is logged
//!   too. Nothing listening on `127.0.0.1:2999` is [`tracing::debug`], the normal state of a
//!   machine with no League game (or no League);
//! * a malformed answer (non-JSON body, an unexpected status) is a [`tracing::warn`], once per
//!   run, and does not end the game: one bad poll is not evidence the game stopped, so the
//!   tracker keeps what it knew.
//!
//! Derived events are logged as derived (`debug` each, `info` for transitions) and handed to
//! the sink. The poller does not decide what they are worth: a driver does
//! ([`crate::EventKind::is_highlight`]), since only it knows whether it can clip.
