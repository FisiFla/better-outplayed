//! GSI document → events, as a pure state machine (spec §7.2).
//!
//! Valve's GSI is a *snapshot* service, not an event stream: the game POSTs the current
//! state whenever it changes (and on a heartbeat), and every conclusion about what
//! happened has to be drawn from the difference between two snapshots. So this module is
//! one function of `previous knowledge + document`, with no socket, no clock and no log —
//! and every rule below is a unit test.
//!
//! # The mapping, stated explicitly
//!
//! | what changed | kind |
//! |---|---|
//! | nothing was in a game, now there is | `GameStart` |
//! | a game was in progress, now there is not (`map.phase == "gameover"`, Dota 2's `POST_GAME`, or an empty map) | `GameEnd` |
//! | `player.match_stats.kills` (Dota 2: `player.kills`) went **up** | `Kill` |
//! | `…deaths` went up | `Death` |
//! | `…assists` went up | `Assist` |
//! | `map.round` went **up** | `RoundStart` |
//! | `round.phase` became `"over"` | `RoundEnd` |
//! | the bomb state became `"planted"` / `"defused"` | `BombPlanted` / `BombDefused` |
//! | anything else | nothing |
//!
//! # Three rules that make it survive real payloads
//!
//! * **A delta, not a count.** The scoreboards are totals, and a total only means something
//!   relative to the previous one. So the tracker keeps a baseline, and it must be the
//!   *same player's* baseline: the `steamid` is compared, and a payload that describes a
//!   different player (a spectator switching point of view) re-baselines silently instead
//!   of reporting somebody else's kills as a jump.
//! * **A jump is one event, not N.** Two kills landing inside one POST window (GSI reports
//!   at a few hertz at best) are one `Kill` event carrying `"delta": 2`. Clipping twice for
//!   one payload would be inventing events that were never separately observed.
//! * **Transitions, not values.** Round and bomb events fire on the *edge*, so the periodic
//!   heartbeat POST — which repeats the current state verbatim — emits nothing. Without
//!   this, a heartbeat would be a clip every ten seconds.
//!
//! # The attach policy
//!
//! Identical to the League tracker's (see [`crate::lol::derive`]): the first document of a
//! game reports `GameStart` and adopts the scoreboard, the round and the bomb state as the
//! baseline. The kills that happened before localplay was watching are not reported — a
//! payload that arrives mid-match must not produce a burst of clips for the whole match so
//! far.
