//! Is a watched game running? Two signals, one answer.
//!
//! Auto-record needs one fact: is a watched title running now. Two sources answer it behind
//! one trait ([`GamePresence`]):
//!
//! | source | how it answers | what it can see |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ProcessWatcher`] | a `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` process list, compared by image name | any title whose executable is configured |
//! | [`LiveClientPresence`] | Riot's Live Client Data API, a `GET` on loopback | League of Legends, while a match is being played |
//!
//! Both are polled on a timer ([`spawn`], [`DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL`]) and answer the same
//! [`Presence`], so debounce, the "already running at start" case and "report a change exactly
//! once" are written once ([`PresenceTracker`]) and tested without a clock, socket or process
//! list.
//!
//! # Which signal for which title
//!
//! Riot publishes a game-state API for one title on the default list: League's Live Client Data
//! API, served on `127.0.0.1:2999` only while a match runs (not in the client, lobby or champ
//! select). League is detected through that read-only `GET`, which cannot fire outside a game.
//!
//! Everything else is recognised by executable name. That includes Valorant: Riot publishes no
//! local game-state service for it (the Riot Client's lockfile-protected HTTP API reports the
//! launcher's session, not a match, is undocumented, and is not used). Valorant is watched by
//! `VALORANT-Win64-Shipping.exe`, the game process present only during a match, not
//! `VALORANT.exe`, the launcher that would be a false positive all evening. Likewise
//! `League of Legends.exe` not `LeagueClient.exe`, and `cs2.exe` not `steam.exe`.
//!
//! # What the process watcher does and does not do
//!
//! [`ProcessWatcher`] calls `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0)` and walks the
//! `PROCESSENTRY32W` records, the enumeration Task Manager performs. It:
//!
//! * never calls `OpenProcess`: no process is opened and no access right requested; a name is
//!   copied out of the snapshot and compared to the configured list;
//! * so reads no memory, injects nothing, hooks nothing and touches no module, window, thread
//!   or handle of another process;
//! * opens no socket (`tests/no_egress.rs` asserts the only socket clients are the loopback
//!   modules);
//! * holds no handle between polls: the snapshot handle is closed before `poll` returns.
//!
//! This matters next to kernel-level anti-cheat. Enumerating image names is what every
//! launcher and overlay does and is the least invasive way to answer the question, but it is
//! still a new capability, so it is off by default: [`GamesSection::auto_record`] is `false`,
//! and with it off nothing is polled, no snapshot taken and no request made
//! ([`GamesSection::start`] returns `None`).
//!
//! # Unverified on Windows
//!
//! [`processes`] is type-checked against `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` but its syscalls are
//! unproven here. It is kept to four calls (`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`, `Process32FirstW`,
//! `Process32NextW`, `CloseHandle`) so the unproven part is small, and everything that decides
//! anything ([`presences_in`]) is pure and tested everywhere. If a protected process's image
//! name were absent from a snapshot under kernel anti-cheat, the result would be a game never
//! detected: a false negative, never a wrong match, since a match requires an equal file name.
