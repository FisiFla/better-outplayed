//! The storage manager's policy (spec §8) as pure, testable logic, plus the executor
//! that applies a plan with the spec's deletion ordering (spec §8.2).
//!
//! The split is deliberate. [`plan_cleanup`] *decides*: it reads nothing but the clip
//! rows it is handed and the clock it is given, so both rules — and every interaction
//! between them — are exhaustively unit-testable with no database and no filesystem.
//! [`execute_cleanup`] *acts*: it deletes rows and unlinks files, and carries the one
//! property the spec makes non-negotiable — the row delete is committed **before** the
//! file is unlinked, and no file is ever unlinked unless a committed row delete handed
//! back its path.
