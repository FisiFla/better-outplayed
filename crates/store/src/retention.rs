//! Retention for the two classes of artefact this application keeps: clips and sessions.
//!
//! [`crate::cleanup`] is one flat policy over the clips directory. A full-session recording is a
//! different class (bigger, longer-lived, managed in whole sessions), and one shared
//! `max_total_bytes` would let whichever class grew first evict the other. So this module adds a
//! second policy beside the first:
//!
//! * a session store over its cap never evicts a clip,
//! * a clips store over its cap never evicts a session,
//! * both use the same two rules, the same reason flags and the same deletion ordering.
//!
//! The clips class of [`plan_retention`] is [`plan_cleanup`] called with the clips half of the
//! policy and converted into this module's plan shape, so the two entry points cannot disagree
//! about the same library.
//!
//! # Deliberate duplication
//!
//! * [`RetentionDeletion`] is [`crate::cleanup::PlannedDeletion`] with [`Subject`] in place of a
//!   bare `id`, so a plan naming sessions and clips says which class an id belongs to.
//! * [`ClassOutcome`] is [`crate::cleanup::CleanupOutcome`] plus the one field a class that can
//!   refuse to remove a path needs.
//!
//! Fusing them with their originals by widening the existing types is deferred: both are part of
//! signatures other crates build against. [`crate::cleanup::DeletionReasons`] is reused verbatim,
//! so both plans explain themselves identically.

/// * A session is aged and ordered by `sessions.started_at`, when its footage begins: a session
///   that started eight days ago and ended yesterday is evicted by a seven-day limit. Aging by
///   `ended_at` would make a session immortal while it kept recording.
///

/// A session whose `ended_at` is NULL is immune to both rules, more strongly than a favourite: its
/// scratch directory is footage that exists nowhere else yet, so deleting it destroys the only copy.

/// * its bytes are counted towards the cap (they are on disk) and in
///   [`ClassPlan::over_cap_by_bytes`], so a live recording that alone exceeds the cap is
///   reported as an unsatisfiable cap rather than paid for out of finished sessions.
///
/// The plan is pure and cannot see the process table, so "still recording" is exactly
