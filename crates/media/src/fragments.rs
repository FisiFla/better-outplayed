//! Splitting ffmpeg's fragmented MP4 output into self-contained fragments.
//!
//! This is what makes an in-memory replay buffer possible. With `-f mp4 -movflags
//! empty_moov+frag_keyframe+default_base_moof` on a pipe, ffmpeg writes one small `ftyp`+`moov`
//! header and then `moof`+`mdat` pairs, one per forced keyframe. Measured on a 6s 320x180
//! capture: a 1249-byte header, then 6 fragments a second apart, each carrying a `tfdt` (base
//! media decode time) in its track's timescale.
//!
//! * A fragment is self-contained. `header + any contiguous range of fragments` is a valid
//!   fragmented MP4, and `ffmpeg -i that -c copy out.mp4` makes it a normal clip: no
//!   re-encoding, no temp segment files, nothing on disk until the user saves.
//! * A fragment starts at a keyframe, because ffmpeg was told `frag_keyframe` and the encoder
//!   forces one every `segment_ms`. A fragment boundary is a cut point with the file-based
//!   segmenter's granularity.
//!
//! The splitter is incremental: push whatever bytes were just read from the pipe and get back
//! any fragments now complete. Nothing is buffered twice; a fragment's bytes move out as soon as
//! its `mdat` has arrived.
