//! The in-memory replay ring and the thread that feeds it.
//!
//! `replayed_replay::MemoryRingBuffer` holds the footage (it takes bytes, so its rules are testable
//! without a pipe); this owns the reader thread on the encoder's output pipe and the lock that
//! lets the pump query the span while the reader adds to it.
//!
//! # A silent reader is the failure this module is built around
//!
//! If the reader stops, nothing raises an error: ffmpeg keeps encoding into a pipe that absorbs
//! several seconds, the pump keeps submitting, and the only symptom is short clips or a frozen
//! `span_ms`. So every exit from the read loop records why it stopped, a panic included (the loop
//! is in `catch_unwind` because a panic bypasses the `?` error path), and [`MemoryRing::trigger`]
//! refuses to serve a clip from a ring known to be dead.
//!
//! # Lock discipline
//!
//! The reader holds the lock while pushing one fragment. A clip assembles its bytes under the lock
//! and splices outside it: the splice runs ffmpeg for as long as the muxer takes, and holding the
//! lock would block the reader, fill the pipe, stall ffmpeg's stdin and the recording still running.
