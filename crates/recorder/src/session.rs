//! Full-session recording: the per-session segment directory, its ledger, the lossless
//! concatenation at stop, and recovery of a session a crash left behind.
//!
//! [`SessionRing`] is deliberately not a replay ring: a four-hour session has no oldest segment to
//! spare, so it scans the same directory names with the same [`replayed_replay::scanner`]
//! functions and never evicts. The bypass is structural (there is no cap to pass), and the scan,
//! sequence reservation and clip window are [`replayed_replay`]'s public pieces
//! ([`SegmentLedger`], [`scanner`], [`window`], [`replayed_replay::splice::ClipSplicer`]);
//! nothing here re-implements a
//! concatenation.
//!
//! ```text

//! │   ├── seg-000000.mp4             <- written by the encoder's segment muxer
