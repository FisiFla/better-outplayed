//! What this machine's hardware video encoders are, and whether they will take a GPU texture.
//!
//! The hybrid path rests on one assumption a development host cannot check: that a hardware
//! encoder MFT exists here and accepts the D3D11 device the capture backend already owns, which
//! avoids reading 33.2 MB back into system memory per frame (~97% of the 4K pipeline's work).
//!
//! So this asks the machine, in the shape of `xtask probe`: it starts Media Foundation,
//! enumerates the hardware encoder MFTs, and runs the handshake the encoder will run
//! (`MFT_MESSAGE_SET_D3D_MANAGER` with a real device manager over a real D3D11 device of the
//! capture path's kind). No window is opened, nothing is captured and no input is synthesised,
//! which matters because the machine runs an anti-cheat.
