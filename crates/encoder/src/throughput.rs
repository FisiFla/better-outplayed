//! How many frames per second this machine can actually encode, measured before it records.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! A diagnostic and a pacing aid, not what makes the media timeline track real time. That is the
//! frame-rate conversion being off ([`video_output_args`]'s `-fps_mode passthrough`), which makes
//! the muxer keep each frame's arrival timestamp. A machine that cannot keep up drops frames
//! (a held frame in the picture) while the clock stays honest.
//!
//! What this number answers is how fast *the encoder this recording will use* encodes at the
//! resolution this recording will use. Pacing capture to it (`replayed_recorder::FpsDecision`)
//! stops the pipeline paying for captures (on the raw-pixel path, a 33 MB GPU-to-CPU readback
//! each) that the encoder would throw away, and tells a user that `encode.fps = 30` is not
//! reachable at 4K here.
//!
//! # Which path it measures
//!
//! There are two pipelines in this app, and the probe measures the one the recording will take
//! ([`measured_path`]):
//!
//! * **the raw-pixel pipe** ([`VideoInput::RawPixels`]): the same ffmpeg invocation the recorder
//!   uses ([`video_input_args`] and [`video_output_args`], shared with
//!   [`crate::FfmpegEncoder::spawn`]) writing to the null muxer. Frames go in over `pipe:0` as
//!   raw BGRA, and only a frame ffmpeg accepted is counted: a completed write means the encoder
//!   consumed that much of the stream.
//! * **the hardware encoder** ([`VideoInput::EncodedBitstream`], the zero-copy path): the Media
//!   Foundation transform the recording uses (the `mft` module, Windows only), fed synthetic GPU
//!   textures on a device of the kind capture creates. No window is opened and nothing is
//!   captured, which matters because the machine runs an anti-cheat.
//!
//! # Why the raw-pixel probe was the wrong number for the zero-copy path
//!
//! It was the only probe there was, and the zero-copy run does not use the path it measures.
//! That probe writes a 33.2 MB raw BGRA frame into a pipe and lets ffmpeg convert it on the CPU
//! — work the zero-copy run never does, because the hardware encoder takes the captured texture
//! straight from VRAM and ffmpeg only copies the resulting bitstream.
//!
//! So the number was a measurement of a pipeline that was not running, and it showed: on a 4K
//! machine it reported 46.3, 59.6, 64.7 and 85.7 fps across four runs of the same idle machine,
//! while the recording in the same runs reached the encoder at 26.9 fps in one and about 59.5 fps
//! in another. It was wrong (about a pipeline that was not running) and unstable (nearly two to
//! one), and the instability has a cause: what it measured — a 33 MB pipe write and the CPU
//! conversion behind it — shares the machine with the game that is being recorded.
//!
//! The old claim in this file, that on Windows "the probe is more optimistic there, not less",
//! was wrong in the only way that mattered: it was not optimistic about Windows, it was
//! measuring a different pipeline altogether.
//!
//! The hardware-encoder probe measures the pipeline that will run, with no pixels crossing the
//! CPU, and it counts the frames the encoder *finished* rather than the frames it was handed.
//! Its window opens on the first frame the encoder finished and closes a budget later, so the
//! number is the encoder's pace rather than the pace at which a probe managed to hand it frames.
//!
//! # What it cannot be
//!
//! It measures the encode path only: the live pipeline adds the capture (a readback, a copy or a
//! texture handover), the pump's pacing and the segment muxing, and the gap is large: at a 4K
//! output with a software encoder the probe reported 62fps sustainable and the pipeline achieved
//! 8 frames a second end to end. So the number is an upper bound on what the pipeline can do,
//! never a promise about it: the encoder's drop counter and rate-limited warning remain the
//! report of what the pipeline achieved.
//!
//! Two more limits of the raw-pixel probe, which the hardware-encoder probe does not have:
//!
//! * It is a lower bound on a software encoder and accurate on a hardware one: a GPU encoder's
//!   throughput depends on resolution, not picture, while libx264's depends on content, so the
//!   probe frames carry a detailed moving pattern (see [`probe_frame`]).
//! * It measures the machine's spare CPU as much as the encoder's speed, because the raw-pixel
//!   path is a CPU conversion: on a machine that is also running a game, that number moves.
//!
//! # When the encoder changes its type
//!
//! Media Foundation's encoders may change their output type mid-stream, and they say so by
//! refusing to produce output: `ProcessOutput` answers `MF_E_TRANSFORM_STREAM_CHANGE`
//! (0xC00D6D61, "a stream change has occurred. Output cannot be produced until the streams have
//! been renegotiated"). A caller that does not renegotiate gets nothing from that encoder ever
//! again, which is why a probe that never set a new type could not measure at all on a machine
//! whose encoder renegotiates.
//!
//! The renegotiation is in the `mft` module, and it is the one the recording uses as well: the
//! output type the encoder itself offers is set again, the input type is set again with it, and
//! the exchange carries on. The choice between the types on offer is a rule that does not need
//! Windows to be tested on, so it lives outside the Windows-only module (`choose_output_type`)
//! and is tested on every host.
//!
//! When the renegotiation cannot be done — the encoder offers nothing for this codec at this
//! size — the probe fails and says what was on offer, and the recording falls back to the
//! configured rate (`replayed_recorder::fps::decide_rate`). A plausible-looking number would be
//! worse than none: it would be written into the capture pacer and the encoder's frame rate.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! The raw-pixel path feeds frames for [`PROBE_BUDGET`] and the child has
//! [`PROBE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`] to finish, past which it is killed and reaped. Memory is one frame
//! buffer at the capture's own size (33.2 MB at 3840x2160). The hardware-encoder path opens a
//! warm-up (in the `mft` module), measures for the same budget, and is bounded past that by the
//! encoder's own slack; it holds one texture, not a frame buffer.
