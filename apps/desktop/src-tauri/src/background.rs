//! The half of the desktop shell that is not a window: the system tray, the close-to-hide
//! rule, the global clip hotkey and the start-with-Windows entry.
//!
//! # Why this file is mostly plain functions
//!
//! The test suite never opens a window, and a tray menu, a hotkey message and a window close
//! need a real desktop. So every decision lives here as a function over plain data
//! ([`MenuAction::label`], [`TrayView::tray_state`], [`dispatch`], [`close_action`],
//! [`sync_autostart`]), and `lib.rs` is a thin translation into Tauri calls.
//!
//! The logic is unit-tested and the wiring compiles for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; the tray
//! appearing, the X hiding the window and a real `Ctrl+F8` producing a clip are not covered by
//! any test.
//!
//! # The one hotkey implementation
//!
//! The chord is parsed and registered by `localplay_events::hotkey`, the module the CLI installs
//! from the same `config.toml`, through [`install_hotkey`]. A registration failure (the chord
//! is somebody else's, including a second localplay) is returned as data the window and the
//! tray can both show.
