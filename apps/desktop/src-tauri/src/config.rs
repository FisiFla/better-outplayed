//! Where the desktop shell reads its settings from, and where it keeps its files.
//!
//! # Why this is not `replayed_cli::config::Config`
//!
//! The CLI owns the full configuration model and this module deliberately does not duplicate
//! it:
//!
//! 1. The shell reads only what it needs: `[storage]` for the review window, plus `[encode]`,
//!    `[mic]` and `[games]` for the settings panel and the options a start is built with. It
//!    captures nothing, so `[buffer]`, `[audio]`, `[hotkeys]` and `[events]` are none of its
//!    business, and re-validating them here would let a capture-only mistake (say
//!    `vendor = "software"`) refuse to open the review UI.
//! 2. Depending on `replayed-cli` for its `Config` would pull the whole capture stack (`wgc`,
//!    `wasapi`, the ffmpeg encoder child) into the GUI binary for a handful of fields.
//!
//! # The invariant that keeps the window usable
//!
//! **Reading applies the engine's rules; writing may add the panel's own.**
//! [`read_effective_settings`] must accept every value a start accepts, because the settings
//! panel renders only once it succeeds: a reader stricter than the engine is a panel that will
//! not open, and so cannot repair the file that stopped it. The panel may refuse more on the way
//! in (`validate_edit`: the fps band, and the `clips_dir` hygiene that keeps the asset-protocol
//! scope off whole volumes), because those refuse a value the user already has on screen.
//!
//! This has gone wrong before: the panel's own copy of the `output_size` rule added a frame
//! bound the engine does not have and trimmed nothing, so a file carrying `" 1920x1080"` recorded
//! perfectly while leaving the settings panel permanently blank and silent.
//!
//! What must not drift is the location the two binaries agree on, which is why [`app_data_dir`]
//! repeats the CLI's rule verbatim: the CLI writes `replayed.db` there and the shell reads the
//! same file. A test pins the parse of the real `config.example.toml` against these sections.
//!
//! Reading the whole file through the CLI's own type would let the engine's rules be borrowed
//! rather than mirrored by hand; that is a bigger change than this module has needed.
