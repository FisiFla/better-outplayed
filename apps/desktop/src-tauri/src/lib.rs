//! The Tauri shell: state, wiring, and the `#[tauri::command]` wrappers that delegate to
//! [`commands`].
//!
//! There is deliberately no logic in this file. Each wrapper resolves the application state and
//! hands the call to a plain function in `commands`; the background half (tray, hotkey thread,
//! window close) is wired here but decided in [`background`]. This is the one place that knows
//! Tauri's types, which keeps the command layer and background logic testable without a Tauri
//! runtime or a window. The wiring itself (the tray appearing, the window hiding, a key
//! arriving) needs a desktop and is not covered by tests.

// Test bodies may unwrap and may chunk by a constant; production code may do neither.
// Scoped to the test build of this crate, so it cannot hide either in shipped code.

// The recording commands are `async`, unlike most of the others, because tauri runs a
// synchronous command on the webview's own thread and these block for real time: `clip_now`
// waits for the post-roll (seconds), and a start runs the encoder smoke test. An `async fn`
// runs on the runtime's workers, keeping the window responsive while a clip is saved.
//
// The same applies to the commands that are not about recording but block just as long: a
// `trim_clip` runs ffmpeg over the whole window, a `thumbnail` runs ffmpeg per clip, a
// `delete_session` removes a directory of footage, `copy_clip_to_clipboard` waits for
// PowerShell, `list_audio_devices` waits for the thread that owns the COM apartment, and
// `update_settings` writes the file and flushes it to disk. Each of those carries
