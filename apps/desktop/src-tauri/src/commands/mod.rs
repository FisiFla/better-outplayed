//! The desktop shell's command layer: everything the IPC commands actually do.
//!
//! # Why the logic lives here and not in the `#[tauri::command]` functions
//!
//! Every function here is a plain, non-async function over explicit dependencies (a [`Store`],
//! an optional [`FfmpegBinaries`], a set of paths, a storage policy), taking no `State`,
//! `AppHandle` or window. The wrappers in `lib.rs` resolve the application state and delegate.
//! That lets the tests drive the real command bodies against a real SQLite store and real
//! ffmpeg-produced files, with no Tauri runtime and no window.
//!
//! # What these commands do not do
//!
//! No command here captures the screen, enumerates windows or synthesises input, and none
//! re-encodes: `trim_clip` is [`replayed_media::edit::trim_lossless`], a stream copy
//! (`-c copy`), and the UI says so.
