//! The health page's data, and the GSI installer behind the settings button.
//!
//! Everything here is a plain function over explicit paths and values, so tests drive it
//! against temporary directories and hand-built statuses with no window or Tauri runtime.
//!
//! # The GSI installer
//!
//! The application does not write into game installation directories on its own. The installer
//! runs only when the user presses the button, writes exactly one file
//! (`gamestate_integration_replayed.cfg`), and never takes the destination from the webview:
//! the command receives a game (`cs2` or `dota2`), the install directory is found here from
//! Steam's own library list, and the final path goes through
//! [`crate::paths::ensure_new_file_within`] against the Steam root before a byte is written, so
//! a symlink or `..` cannot walk the write out of the game's folder.
//!
//! # The file carries the *live* binding
//!
//! The listener reads its token once, when it starts, and the port it binds may be an
//! ephemeral one the operating system picked. So the installer never re-reads the token file:
//! it is handed the binding the running listener serves ([`GsiBinding`]) and writes that
//! binding's own text ([`GsiBinding::cfg`]). A file naming another token or another port is a
//! game whose every POST is answered `403`, and the log's advice ("install the generated cfg
//! and restart the game") cannot fix a file the application wrote itself.
//!
//! # The root the write is contained by
//!
//! The install folder is found through `libraryfolders.vdf`, a file any local user can edit.
//! A folder that file names is therefore not a root a write may be contained by, so the
//! folder is checked against the Steam roots the operating system knows about
//! ([`steam_roots`]) before one is used: it has to be exactly a known root's
//! `steamapps/common/<game folder>`. A folder that is not is refused rather than trusted.
//!
//! # The file is written atomically
//!
//! The write goes to a uniquely-named temporary file in the same directory, is flushed to
//! disk, and is then renamed over the destination. The game therefore reads either the old
//! file or the new one, never a half-written mixture, and a crash (or a full disk) cannot
//! leave a truncated cfg behind.
