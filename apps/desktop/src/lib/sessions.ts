/**
 * Turning a session row into what the review view shows, and deciding what can be done to it.
 *
 * Kept out of the components for the same reason `clips.ts` is: this is where the decisions
 * that a screenshot cannot check live — whether a session's length is known at all, and
 * whether a clip can be extracted from it yet.
 *
 * The one thing here that is easy to get wrong, and that `extractionBlocker` exists to get
 * right: a session reports `duration_ms: 0` when its length is **unknown**, not when it is
 * zero. That happens while it is still recording and for a session recovered from a crash.
 * Drawing a zero-length axis, or offering to extract from it, would both present an unknown
 * as a fact.
