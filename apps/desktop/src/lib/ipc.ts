/**
 * The one place the frontend talks to the Rust side.
 *
 * Two things are worth knowing about this file:
 *
 * 1. **Arrow arguments are snake_case.** The commands are declared
 *    `#[tauri::command(rename_all = "snake_case")]`, so `trim_clip`'s parameters arrive as
 *    `start_ms` / `end_ms` — not the camelCase Tauri would use by default. A mismatch here
 *    is a runtime error ("missing required key start_ms") rather than a compile error on
 *    either side, which is why `ipc.test.ts` asserts the exact key names against a mocked
 *    `invoke`.
 * 2. **Playback goes through the asset protocol, not through a command.** `convertFileSrc`
 *    turns an absolute path into the `asset:` URL that `<video>` can play, and Tauri's
 *    protocol handler checks it against the scope configured in `tauri.conf.json` (and
 *    extended at runtime in `src/lib.rs`). There is no file server in this application,
 *    and no command returns file contents.
 * 3. **Every failed command is written to the application's log here**, by the one wrapper
 *    below, before the rejection reaches the caller. The components turn failures into a
 *    banner for whoever is in front of the window; the log is for whoever is not, and a
 *    shipped window has no console anyone can read.
