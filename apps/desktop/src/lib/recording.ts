 * window cannot be opened by this project's test suite, so the display rules are pinned by
 * tests rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * The numbers come from `localplay-recorder`, the engine the CLI also drives, so what is
 * described here is a real capture (or the honest absence of one). Nothing in this file
 * invents a value the engine does not publish: a rate that has not been measured yet says
 * so, rather than printing `0.0fps` next to a running recorder.
