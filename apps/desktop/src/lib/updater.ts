/**
 * The updater: the one thing in replayed that reaches another machine.
 *
 * Everything else in this application talks to this machine or to nothing at all. This
 * module is the exception, and the exception is deliberate and narrow:
 *
 * - the **user** asks. There is no check at startup, no polling, no background task and
 *   no telemetry. The only way in is the "Check for updates" button in the settings
 *   panel, and the only request that leaves the machine is the one that button makes.
 * - the request goes to **one fixed URL**: the GitHub Releases "latest" asset,
 *   `plugins.updater.endpoints` in `tauri.conf.json`. The frontend cannot change it.
 * - the **request is made by the Rust side**, not by this window. The plugin's own
 *   client fetches the release manifest, and the webview's content security policy
 *   (`connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost` in `tauri.conf.json`) says so: the window
 *   cannot open a connection of its own to anything.
 * - what comes back is **verified** before it is installed. The plugin checks the
 *   artifact's minisign signature against the public key pinned in `tauri.conf.json`,
 *   and refuses an artifact that does not match it. A tampered manifest or a swapped
 *   file fails that check and nothing is installed.
 *
 * The module is a thin wrapper rather than a call site, so that the panel does not have
 * to know about the plugin's `Update` resource, its download events, or the fact that
 * a resource has to be released when the user does not want the update after all.
