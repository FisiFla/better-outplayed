.SYNOPSIS
    Run `cargo xtask verify` on this Windows machine, in its interactive desktop session,
    from a shell that does not have one (an SSH session, a service, a CI runner).

.DESCRIPTION
    The capture path needs an interactive desktop session: Windows Graphics Capture
    captures a session's desktop, and a process started by a service or over plain SSH
    without `-t` either has no window station/desktop of its own or captures session 0's
    invisible one. So the harness has to be started *inside* the session the human is
    logged into.

    This script does that with a one-shot scheduled task:

      1. registers a task whose principal is the current user with `-LogonType
         Interactive`, so Windows runs it in that user's interactive session;
      2. starts it and waits for the marker file the worker writes when the harness has
         finished;
      3. reads the exit marker, prints where the report is, and leaves it in place;
      4. unregisters the task — in a `finally`, so it happens whether the run succeeded,
         failed or timed out.

    It creates no windows, sends no keystrokes and needs nothing from the human: the
    clip the harness takes is triggered from inside the application
    (`buffer --self-test-clip-after`), never by synthesising input. That is deliberate —
    on a machine running kernel-level anti-cheat, synthetic input is hostile behaviour,
    and a verification that gets the machine banned is not verification.

    The report lands on the *box* (by default under <repo>\target\verify\); copy it back
    with `scp`/`Type` or attach it from there.

.PARAMETER Repo
    The checkout to verify. Defaults to this script's own repository root.

.PARAMETER Report
    Where the Markdown report goes. Defaults to <Repo>\target\verify\report-<timestamp>.md.

.PARAMETER Seconds
    How much media the buffer accumulates before the self-test clip (the harness's
    --seconds). Default 45.

.PARAMETER DevSoftwareEncoder
    Pass --dev-software-encoder (libx264, no GPU encoder needed). Only useful for a
    development host; on a real Windows box leave it off so the hardware path is verified.

.PARAMETER WaitSeconds
    How long to wait for the harness before giving up and cleaning up. Default 2700 (45
    minutes — the release build is the slow part on a cold machine).

.PARAMETER Worker
    Internal: the mode the scheduled task runs. Not meant to be typed by a human.

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\verify-in-interactive-session.ps1
